## COOKIES POLICY

### moduszero.github.io/landing

Access to this Website may involve the use of cookies. Cookies are small amounts of information stored in the browser used by each User —on the various devices they may use to browse— so that the server remembers certain information that only the server that implemented it will subsequently read. Cookies facilitate navigation, make it more user-friendly, and do not damage the browsing device.

Cookies are automatic procedures for collecting information related to the preferences determined by the User during their visit to the Website in order to recognize them as a User, personalize their experience and use of the Website, and may also, for example, help identify and resolve errors.

The information collected through cookies may include the date and time of visits to the Website, the pages viewed, the time spent on the Website, and the sites visited just before and after it. However, no cookie allows contact with the User's phone number or any other means of personal contact. No cookie can extract information from the User's hard drive or steal personal information. The only way for private User information to be part of the Cookie file is for the user to personally give that information to the server.

Cookies that allow a person to be identified are considered personal data. Therefore, the Privacy Policy described above will apply to them. In this sense, the User's consent will be necessary for their use. This consent will be communicated, based on an authentic choice, offered through an affirmative and positive decision, before the initial processing, and will be removable and documented.

The information obtained refers, for example, to the number of pages visited, the language, the place of the IP address from which the User accesses, the number of Users who access, the frequency and recurrence of visits, the visit time, the browser used, the operator, or the type of device from which the visit is made. This information is used to improve the Website and detect new needs to offer Users optimal quality Content and/or services. In any case, the information is collected anonymously, and Website trend reports are prepared without identifying individual users.

### Disabling, rejecting, and deleting cookies

The User can disable, reject, and delete cookies —totally or partially— installed on their device through their browser settings (including, for example, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Explorer). In this sense, the procedures for rejecting and deleting cookies may differ from one Internet browser to another.
